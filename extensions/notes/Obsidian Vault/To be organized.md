It would be really cool. If once I connected Luna to my notes, I can set up a real time voice chat that could’ve read my notes and I could basically have a conversation on my project and then you could update my notes as I think of things.

Increase the Allocation of thinking, tokens to models as they age and progress

Is it worth enabling test time training data for the RL model? I don’t think it would be enough given how slow are all trains

It would be really cool if I could just write all my notes here and everyting would get automatially sorted into the proper project. i had a lot of good thoughts on my walk. luna should be a 3 layer system at its core. layer 1 is just gonna be core interaction agent that allows the user to interact with any number of tools. it will automatically generate the schmea and handel the parrleized requrests and stuff. at some point i will also have to figure out how to enable backgroud tasks idk i havent thought about that too much.  layer 2 will be the automation layer. it will handle scheduled tasks, triggers, saved task flows and memories. expamples for wach would be creating a morning report, trigger a prompt to the use if they are behind on calories for the day, a nighttime flow that turns off all lights and devices, and a memory that lrl means living room light. layer 3 will be the heart of luna that will kinda bring her to life. im not really sure what im going to do with this yet but it will basically just watch everything the user does and try to create reminders about thing to do or improve. like if it notices that i havent taken a break in a while it will remind me to take a trip.

the other major thing i want to do that would add a lot of wow factor would be 1 creating a sperate tool mode for layer one which simply cuts out the synth layer and returns all the domain data and then 2 plug that straight into the new realtime model from openai. it would be far more natural to interact with it like that. i mean if my voice assistnt suports not having to say hey luna everytime it wouldnt be that diffrent but it would definaly increase how natual the system is to interact with

- i need to figure out a way to do macros with grocy but i dont really need to do that first thing its not nessecerly primary functionality
- reserach what is currently availble for active voice agents meaning realtime models that can use tools can be interupted
- update the openaiserver for the voice assistnat
- add multi provider support so i can use google and openai


Add point system to do list and build reward system out of it

Should people be able to form illegal acts on AINPC‘s in a game and if so, is there a limit conscious and list AI should be
