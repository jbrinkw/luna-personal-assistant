chess: pretty simple just describe differnt chess layout with differnt levels of complextity and abstraction

**easy:** starting layout, describe where every piece goes

**medium:** describe a layout and then descibe a series of moves either by expictly saying where to move and capture or by using more abtract langague like discribeing a layout and then saying “capture the rook with the bishup” so the model would have to understand all the positions and possible move and**hard:** descibe multiple moves in a row from a starting posistion. so the model would have to think about each move and how it changes the state.
