### Eva Projects:

- Security Cam
- Food Stock/ Recipe suggestion
- Jamie feeder/ crate camera
- Auto lock
- door closer. use a breakable 3d printed part for overload protection

### MiscNew:

- use luna to do explore an introduction do various subject. focus on conceptual understanding to learn how I can use different thing
- Teach a chat bot to learn some feymen
- Ai thinking without words faster?

### Misc:

- How do training images get pulled out of weights
- ai to control a vr game mechanics Alfred
- make my 3d printed car autonomous and then make a full size go kart
- Powered wingsuit
- Compare bci classification between spectogran cnn and rnn
- Train a model of mini Doug with one leg while at 29 palms
- Music genre classifier
- **Self driving car to chase, dog toy**
- audio version of dall e
- Dalle trained on data which inputs are what a human sees and hears and a vocalization of what that makes them think of
- Ai for witty responses
- Encourage generalization by discouraging results close to inputs
- **Make memories with transfer learning, when an agent encounters a type of problem space it doesn’t know how solve it uses the format of the inputs and unsupervised classification to find a model that is similar and then automatically makes a new model with transfer learning. the agent will add a new model to its memory every time it sees something new. all inputs will first be checked against the memory to see if it has already learned how to solve this problem. if it has already learned it’ll use the closest model (maybe multiple models if there are multiple with a close similarity score. then if there is no close model it will go through the process to make a new one.**
- **OpenCOG**
- Create a chatbot version of myself with a voice synthesizer
- **unsupervised learning to translate a video feed of a person fov as the walk through an environment to a audio signal or hapic vest kinda thing to navigate an environment without use of human sight**
- hide identifiers in models. Example: when training a language model make a custom coded sequence along with a prompt for it. then if you suspect the model was copied you can give it the prompt to the code and see if it finishes it
- remake the black mirror muting feature with selective noise cancellation. next next level would be a biological information firewall that taps into the nerves from various senses and cant selectively inhibit specific signals or generate fake ones. neuroprosthetic device… what is the state of nerve fowarding for muscular prosthetics
- picture rnn to generate layers of a 3d model
- to increase truefulness in ai have something like a pca mapping of the data and find the most reavent data to the prompt and include it in the prompt for the answer
- **Ai the can write programs using modules of specialized models**
- **make a convex hull inside the latent space of a gan using latent vectors from a series of images to generate images within the convex hull to generate variations based on multiple images**
- use a projector and vr to make a big virtual whiteboard. maybe use an existing drawing game and hack it to make it work for this
- make a drone to pick up food for me
- Experience high dimensional space by using multiple frequencies on multiple senses
- Deaf people can't talk because they have to auditory feedback when they speak. Use the confidence if an advanced speech to text model to provide feedback
- Self driving bike
- Just llm to process news for trading
- quickly make embeddings for a video or webpage for gpt to generate questions and exercises about
- vr ai training. boxing game where you have to touch the other person in a certain spot without them touching you
- have the internet (something smaller for testing) available to an lmm during training so it uses less of its connections to memorize stuff and more for thinking
- a vector database of models based on a visual input for a rl model paired the an algo that detects unfamiliar situations and replays the scenario until it figures it out. maybe returns the x closest models with relative strength based on relevance
