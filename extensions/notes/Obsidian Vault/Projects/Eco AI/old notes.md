**Eco AI**

- **Basic Survival:**
    - **Level 1a:** Agent finds food and water to survive.
    - **Level 1b:** Agent brings wood back to the house to build it.
    - **Level 1c:** Combined (food/water and house-building).

---

- **Collaboration:**
    - **Level 2:** Same as Level 1 but with 2 agents and limited resources, so they have to share to survive. If one dies, they both die.
    - **Level 2b:** Increase map size and allow stockpiling at home.
- **Fundamental Skills:**
    
    Exploration, memorizing significant places and how to get there, collaboration, specialization.
    
    - **Specialization:** Resource gathering, house building, tool building.
    - **Level 2b cont.:** Agents will get better at a task the more they do it. To build the house, an agent will have to do some tasks in the house area. Encourage one agent to specialize in house building and the other in resource gathering.

---

- **Exploration:**
    - **Level 3a:** Increase world size and limit view distance. Resources don’t regenerate, so the agent will have to keep exploring to find food and survive. Food may spoil, so if the agent spends too much time in the same place, it will die.
    - **Level 3b:** Food is scattered throughout the map, but water is only available in a few spots, so the agent has to memorize the locations of water and return to them to survive.
    - **Level 3c:** The agent has to find wood to build a house and increase food and water storage so the agent can stockpile for future adventures.

**Extra Needs:**

Reproduction, social interaction, rest.

**Extra Notes:**

Each specialization's effect can be generalized somehow to encourage agents to gain multiple specializations in the long run.

---

**Next Level:**

Agents fight enemies or face something dangerous. The environment gets bigger, and agents can’t see the entire map. Exploration becomes important, and agents may separate tasks like resource gathering and journeying. There could be something like population increase or "body-making" to meet needs.
