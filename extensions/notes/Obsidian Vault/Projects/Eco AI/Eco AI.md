[[old notes]]

  

Just to recap this is supposed to be an AI agent capable of living and organizing in a world with other copies of itself. I got the original idea from a game called eco where you have to save the world from a meteor without destroying it in the process. I could use some other RL env but I want to this because I find it personally interesting and I can start simple and build it up at my own pace while I learn.
